<h1>About</h1>
<p>
<br>A project written in pairs for a programming languages class.
The arithmetic module was developed by my peer, while I was
responsible for the remainder of the project. The driving
idea was to design a language that&#8217;s form is based on its
function, and whose function is unique. The project is functional
but not feature-complete. It allows for the modeling of basic
arithmetic systems, but lacks recursion and conditional
statements, which are key to modeling more complex systems.
